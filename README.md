Common SQL recipes and best practises

## Purpose

This repository aims to provide a number of best practises and ideas on how to construct queries that provide interesting data in a way that works well with our platform.

Use these queries as you please for educational purposes and to adjust them to suit your specific needs.

## Reference

These queries can be used to run within the deltaDNA platform in the data mining section. Alternatively when adding either _live or _dev to the table selection you can use these queries in your favourite DB tool via direct access as well.

[Data mining reference](http://docs.deltadna.com/reference/analyze/data-mining/ "data mining").

[Direct SQL Access reference](http://docs.deltadna.com/reference/analyze/direct-sql-access/ "direct access").

The queries are executed by an HP vertica DBMS and the SQL dialect used is defined by them and described in the following documentation:
